## Step-by-step guide from Week 7 Lab: Vim Step 4-9

### Part One: Step 4 From Week 7 Lab
- From your desktop, open terminal / command prompt. I am on a Mac so I will use the Mac jargon. First, press `CMD + Space`, search for `Terminal` then press enter. To log in to my ieng6 account, on the terminal prompt, I will type `ssh man026@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu`. The reason I am using @ieng6-201 is because there are some devices that I have issues with so -201 is the best option. Since I already have a private SSH key store, the terminal will output below:
```
trilosophe@Trilosophes-MBP-16 ~ % ssh man026@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu
