## Step-by-step guide from Week 7 Lab: Vim Step 4-9

### Part One: Step 4 From Week 7 Lab
- From your desktop, open terminal / command prompt. I am on a Mac so I will use the Mac jargon. First, press `CMD + Space`, search for `Terminal` then press enter. To log in to my ieng6 account, on the terminal prompt, I will type `ssh man026@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu`. The reason I am using @ieng6-201 is because there are some devices that I have issues with so -201 is the best option. Since I already have a private SSH key store, the terminal will output below:
```
trilosophe@Trilosophes-MBP-16 ~ % ssh man026@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu

To begin work for one of your courses [ cs15lwi24 ], type its name 
at the command prompt.  (For example, "cs15lwi24", without the quotes).

To see all available software packages, type "prep -l" at the command prompt,
or "prep -h" for more options.

- I have successfully log on to the virtual lab machine.

### Part Two: Step 5 From Week 7 Lab
- After logging on to the lab machine, if I haven't done it already then I should create an SSH key in order to `git clone` with SSH. However, I already completed that step so I am ready to clone the forked repository from lab 7. In the terminal, I will run `git clone git@github.com:man3ng/lab7-assignment.git` to clone with SSH. It will output as below after you finish cloning.
```
[man026@ieng6-201]:~:151$ git clone git@github.com:man3ng/lab7-assignment.git
Cloning into 'lab7-assignment'...
